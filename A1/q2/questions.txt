For the following questions, please answer concisely in bullet points.

Q1: Dataset Size
- In general, if I increase the size of the training set, what can we expect about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?

- In general, if I increase the size of the test set, what can we expect the about the model's
  training error? What about the test error?

- How much data should I try to obtain if I want to build a good model?


Q2: Model Complexity
- In general, if the model is too simple, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?

- In general, if the model is too complex, what can we conclude about the training and test errors?

- For each dataset, which (degree) model gives the best performance? How did you find out?

- For each dataset, what degree of polynomial do you think was used to generate the data?


Q3: Regularization
- In general, what does regularization do to the weights? Note: You may want to look at the weight values.

- In general, if we set lambda (l2_coef) to 0, what do we get?

- In general, what does increasing lambda (l2_coef) do to our loss function?
